# first-portfolio

This assignment has been by far the best learning experience; trying to work out the kinks and problem solve every issue that was in the way of making the page do and look exactly how I wanted really helped cement the key fundamentals and gave me confidence in my ability to do so.

Over the time it took to make this portfolio I gained more knowledge about linear-gradients and how to play with the value to make it look presentable.

I also became really comfortable with flex-box and specifically the importance of the grow, shrink and basis properties.

I enjoyed utilizing psuedo-classes, and I can see how important they are for presentability.

Though I can tell what I've built is still very elementary, I am proud of the work I was able to do and in the time I was able to complete it in.
